Things to study

1. All Error metrics
    classification metrics:
        MAE = mean absolute error deltaY/n
        Accuracy = TP+TN/TP+TN+FP+FN
        R2 = 1 - sum(deltaY)^2/ (y - y_mean)^2
        Precision = TP/ TP + FP
        Recall = TP / TP + FN
        ROC-AUC curve 
2. All machine learning Algorithms formulas
    Bayes Theorem

    Linear Regression
        formula - Y = wX +b
        error - w = w - alpha*dw, b = b - alpha*db
    Logistic Regression
        formula - z = B0 + B1x1 + B2x2, P(y=1|x1,x2) = 1/1+e-(z)
        loss function = log loss function
    KNN

    KMeans
