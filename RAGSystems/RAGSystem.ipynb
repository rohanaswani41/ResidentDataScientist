This is NOT hipster paradise, and it\\'s NOT gangster\\'s paradise either!  Our neighborhood is very residential and typically quieter than most urban cities. The summertime is louder on the block because very few people have air conditioning and enjoy hanging outside. The neighbors are friendly, so say hello as you pass! The ages of the neighborhood are very diverse (young children to elderly homeowners who have been here for 40 years). Flatbush has a lot of local charm and people with hearts of gold.  Jamaican food is plentiful (jerk chicken- yeah!); there is also a local donut shop nearby, Subway, Thai, sushi, pizza, and Indian food for delivery or a 5-15 minute walk to the restaurant, as well as many chain stores like Dominos, Dunkin\\' Donuts, IHOP, and Walgreens drug store. There is also a Planet Fitness (handy for Black-Card members!) Just a 10 minute walk down the road is\\nnotes=>**NOTE: Though our CHECK-IN and CHECK-OUT times are VERY FLEXIBLE, it is important to understand that many times, we have guests back to back.  CHECK IN: This means, if you are coming in on a red-eye flight and are arriving early in the morning, the previous guest may still be occupying the room until after we have both left for work meetings. As we work and are not a full-time business (just a couple renting out a room to meet awesome travelers), we may not be able to change the sheets and thoroughly clean the room until later in the evening, sometimes as late as 7pm. You are welcome to drop your bags at any time on Check in Day! This is usually no issue 90% of the time. CHECK OUT: Additionally, because of time constraints, we may ask  that you be packed up and OUT of the apartment on the morning of your checkout. You are always welcome to leave your bags, especially for those guests who have late evening flights (Who wants, or COULD, drag all that gear around?!). Thank you so much in\\naccess=>Use of the... -SHARED bathroom with tub and detachable shower-head -parlor/living room -kitchen to eat in and cook (we must show you how to use the stove and toaster oven) -occasional use of clothes washer and dryer  (once we give a briefing on the appliances)\\ninteraction=>WE LIVE HERE so we are usually home in the evenings.  Zach mostly works from home in the day, so he is available if guests are in need of anything, but mostly keeps quiet to himself on his laptop or in his basement studio. Christa works out of the home and is usually available via text messaging on What\\'s Ap or iMessage for iPhone.\\nhouse_rules=>- Most importantly to us, please take your shoes off before entering the apartment. - This is a non-smoking property. All smoking must be done at the curb due to asthma and allergies.  - Absolutely NO GUESTS who have not been previously approved through Airbnb reservation or in person. Please do not bring anyone into the house. - AIR CONDITIONING: This window unit costs a large amount of money for us to run, so we want to make sure we can afford to keep providing it. The room is rather small and well insulated, and cools down within 7 minutes of turning it on. ...Please, do not raise the level over 4. It should be cool in your room, not frigid, which would likely be about $10/day to run it (yikes).  ...There is no energy saver mode, so please remember to turn it OFF when you leave. ...Please keep your door closed at all times when the unit is in use. - Be courteous to other guests staying: leave the bathroom as you found it by cleaning up hair and any spills.

In 1997, Utne Reader rated it one of the 15 \"hippest\" neighborhoods in North America. The neighbourhoods of Mile End, Côte Saint-Louis, and Milton-Parc (including the McGill Ghetto) are also located in the borough. Montreal\\'s Little Portugal neighbourhood is situated in the western portion of the borough.

The room you’ll be staying in is beautiful and bright with lots of privacy and will accommodate all your needs while you\\'re on the road. Its one of three Rooms in this typical Plateaux Apartment with wooden floor, tiny balcony and direct access to the Backyard. Your room will have a queen size bed and is actually the one who gets the most sunlight in the house. The\\nneighborhood_overview=>As for the area, you\\'ll be spoiled as you\\'ll find everything in walking distance, like: - for the morning\\'s best bloody bakery ever \"Kouign-Amann\", a french bretonne style bakery with croissants and chocolatines to die for plus loads of other delicious pastries (1 min) - The toughest competition of coffee shops in whole Montreal among them \"Khawa Cafe\" with great coffee and amazing Couscous for lunch, \"Le Couteau\" where coffee is art or the super friendly window in the Wall \"la distributrice\"  - for healthy lunches and Lunch packs for the road there is nothing better than \"trip de bouffe\"  -for  the whole dose of Montreal we have \"La Banquise\" and \"Schwart\\'z\"  each 10 min by foot from our house -the beautiful Mont Royal Park with its iconic hill and great view over the whole city just 10 min from our doorstep if you want to feel out of town while you\\'re actually right in the middle of it  -\"JR Cyclery\" is renting quality bikes for unbeatable 15 $ for 4 hours or 24 $ for 24 hours, Other\\nnotes=>Last but not least about me... I am a German Chef and I love my profession because it lets me combine my passion for food with my passion for travel and meeting new people. I love to discover new country\\'s and like to let my mind be broadened by new people, new cultures  and new food! As already mentioned I really believe in the Values of Airbnb and the sharing economy. For this reason it is very important to me that people don\\'t take my place simply as a cheap replacement for a hotel. People who stay with me are usually having a great time, not only cause the room is nicely decorated or the place is so central but because they find a personal note that they wouldn\\'t find in a hotel. However this only works if people are open minded and don\\'t take things for granted. For this Reason I will simply refuse any requests which carry no personal message or people who think they are dealing with representative of Hotels. ;) I can\\'t wait to meet you and to share some stories and laughs! See yo\\naccess=>The Bathroom, which you\\'ll be sharing with me, comes fully equipped with Hair dryer, fresh towels and usually some soap and shampoo. My Kitchen replaces the Living Room, meaning it is here where all the social life takes place. In the Kitchen you will find a Nespresso machine and a milk frother for your Coffees in the morning! You\\'ll have your own shelf in the fridge and the kitchen as well is free to your use. (just don\\'t forget to wash up ;) ) Be assured that in the apartment you will find all basic appliances like wifi, washer. *Booking for 30 nights minimum*\\ninteraction=>I live in the apartment with my girlfriend and our beautiful cat. I have a pretty busy life, professionally and private, so usually you should have the place to yourself on most times of the day. However it is important to me to make myself available for my guests and I will always be very happy to advise you on how to hit the city according to your preferences ( also check out my guidebook on the bottom of the page). You also wouldn\\'t be the first of my guests to be sharing laughs and good stories about travels, music and whatnot over a refreshing drink. ;)\\nhouse_rules=>-There aren\\'t many rules you have to follow in our place, follow your common sense, act not much different as if you would stay with a friend... -Be clean, be respectful! -Wash your dishes please! -I am happy to let you use the amenities in the house, please just ask for permission beforehand. -We are not a Hotel but people who seek good company from all over the world!

We are near the Jamaica Bay Riding Academy, Gateway National Park and Canarsie Pier.  If you like bike riding you could take the Gateway National Park bike path to Brighton Beach--the ride along the water is beautiful and peaceful. As far as cafes-- there are a few spots in Canarsie but I prefer to take the L train to Williamsburg or Downtown Brooklyn to go to some of Brooklyn\\'s most revere hip spots.  The total ride to the hippest areas in Brooklyn is about 15 to 30 min depending on the area and on the (Website hidden by Airbnb) Manhattan the first stop is 40 min).  By-the-way, I\\'ve seen other posting with spaces  in Canarsie that are located further away from our block, and they are claiming 20 to 30 min to Manhattan--- this is a lie.
